                Online Event Ticketing System


This project involves the development of a full-stack web application for an online event ticketing system. The application allows users to browse, search, and purchase tickets for various events such as concerts, sports games, and theater shows. The system supports different user roles: Standard Users who can book tickets, Event Organizers who can manage events, and System Admins with full control over the platform. The backend is built using MongoDB for storing data, and the frontend features interactive pages like event listings, booking systems, and user dashboards.

Key features include:

        Event browsing and search functionality
        Ticket booking and checkout system
        User-specific dashboards and booking history
        Admin panel for event management
        Database integration using MongoDB
        This project involves tasks such as version control with GitHub, backend and frontend development, full project integration, and testing, culminating in the deployment of the system.
